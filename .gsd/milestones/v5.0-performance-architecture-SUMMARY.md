# Milestone: v5.0-performance-architecture

## Completed: 2026-02-07

## Goal
Optimize the core engine for high-performance hardware, ensure resiliency against interruptions, and finalize the transition to a clean, plugin-based architecture.

## Must-Haves
- [x] FFmpeg Hardware Acceleration (NVENC/VAAPI)
- [x] Resumable Extraction (Mid-run checkpoints)
- [x] Proactive Memory Management (Dynamic batch sizing)
- [x] Complete removal of legacy metric logic from `core/models.py`
- [x] Self-contained Operators (handling their own dependencies)

## Phases
1. **Phase 6: Architectural Cleanup** — 2026-02-07
2. **Phase 7: Hardware-Accelerated Extraction** — 2026-02-07
3. **Phase 8: Proactive Memory & Resiliency** — 2026-02-07
