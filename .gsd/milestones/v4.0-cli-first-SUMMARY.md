# Milestone Audit: v4.0-cli-first

**Audited:** 2026-02-07

## Summary
The `v4.0-cli-first` milestone has successfully concluded. We have achieved a stable CLI foundation, implemented a performant caching layer, and introduced a new Photo Culling mode with external interop (XMP).

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Phases Completed | 5 (Phase 0-4) |
| Must-Haves Met | 5 / 5 |
| Technical Debt Items | 2 (Seeding mismatch, Recursion) |
| Health | **GOOD** |

## Must-Haves Status
| Requirement | Verified | Evidence |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| Fix Tab 1 \u2192 Tab 2 UI blocker | \u2705 | Phase 0 verification + UI tests |
| `cli.py` with subcommands | \u2705 | `tests/e2e/test_photo_cli.py` + manual |
| Run fingerprinting (Caching) | \u2705 | Phase 2 verification |
| RAW/JPEG Ingest (ExifTool) | \u2705 | Phase 3/4 verification |
| XMP sidecar export | \u2705 | Phase 3/4 verification |

## Concerns
- **Seeding Mismatch**: There's a lingering bug where redundant scene seeds are generated. While it doesn't break the workflow, it adds noise to the "Subject" tab.
- **Photo Mode Recursion**: Currently limited to flat folders. Users with nested shoot structures will need manual organization.
- **Dependency Growth**: Added `ExifTool` as a system requirement. We should ensure this is well-documented in the installation guide.

## Recommendations
1. **Fix Seeding Logic**: Dedicate a small "Quality Spike" to resolve the redundant seeds in `.gsd/TODO.md`.
2. **Expand Photo Ingest**: Add `--recursive` support to the CLI and UI in the next minor version (v4.1).
3. **Formalize Release**: Tag the current state as `v4.0.0` in Git.

## Technical Debt to Address
- [ ] Investigate seeding mismatch (TODO.md id: 4)
- [ ] Implement recursive folder scanning for Photo Mode
- [ ] Unify logging format between CLI and UI for better supportability
